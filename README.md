Première implémentation du langage Toy (autrefois ToySanta).
First implementation of the Toy (formerly Toy Santa) language.

The .toy files are code examples of the Toy (formerly ToySanta) language. They can be executed by the interpreter. But for now, you need to supply the filename at the interpreter's prompt. The source is in C++, using STL. It should run on Linux without much modifications.

If you can read French, the tuto1.pdf file is a tutorial about programming with the Toy language.
Si vous savez lire le français, le fichier tuto1.pdf est un tutoriel pour apprendre à programmer en langage Toy.

# The source code is under active development
It is not yet useful for a 'general purpose' role. There's no version release yet. Right now, some features are under active development (pointers).

# For linux
The 'linux' folder has a version of the Toy language that is compilable with MonoDevelop.
