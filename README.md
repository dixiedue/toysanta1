# toysanta1
Première implémentation du langage Toy (autrefois ToySanta).
First implementation of the Toy (formerly Toy Santa) language.

The .toy files are code examples of the Toy (formerly ToySana) language. They can be executed by the interpreter. But for now, you need to supply the filename at the interpreter's prompt. The source is in C++, using STL. It should run on Linux without much modifications.
